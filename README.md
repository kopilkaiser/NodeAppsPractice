# Practicing Node.js for the first time and it is looking good. I've caught hold of it and going on a good workflow. Indeed, it is a lot to learn. But, that is the fun part :)

### My background is from .Net Development using ASP.Net Core 8 MVC 5. It was not hard to pick up because I've had prior knowledge of C# and JavaScript.

### I'm looking forward in building a more robust and intuitive application onwards.

## Technologies used:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - ejs 
  
## node_modules used:
  - nodemon
  - browser-sync
  - concurrently
  - body-parser

* I've made use of Chrome browser's and JavaScript's built it object 'sessionStorage' to store items details in a JSON string format.
   - I used JSON.stringify to store object (cart) in Application -> Storage -> SessionStorage
   - Then use JSON.parse(stringifyItem) -> to convert back to a cart object in JavaScript to access the saved items and display it on to the cartDetailsContainer
 
* I've implemented dynamic element insertion from the JavaScript by adding DocumentObjectModel(DOM) elements from the JavaScript extracting the details of cart.items
* Customised scrollbar for the website using the Chrome's supported '-webkit-scrollbar' on the element which has overflow. And setting properties to each -webkit-scrollbar properties like main::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb, main::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover (changes background-color when user hover mouse on the scrollbar) and many more UI improvements.
