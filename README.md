# Practicing Node.js for the first time and it is looking good. I've caught hold of it and going on a good workflow. Indeed, it is a lot to learn. But, that is the fun part :)
### My background is from .Net Development using ASP.Net Core 8 MVC 5. It was not hard to pick up because I've had prior knowledge of C# and JavaScript.
### I'm looking forward in building a more robust and intuitive application onwards.

## Technologies used:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - ejs 
  
## node_modules used:
  - nodemon
  - browser-sync
